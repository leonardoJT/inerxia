    File        : adm2/cltorsvr.i
    Purpose     : This include file is used many times in data.p to send
                  a request (in the form of a function) to the
                  appServer if the ASDivision is "Client" or to send the
                  request up the Super Procedure stack or just execute
                  the code for the function if we are local.

    Syntax      : {src/adm2/cltorsvr.i FnctName RetType "param(s)" Super}
                     Where FnctName is the name of the Function to call
                           ReType is the return type of the function
                                  (either Log, Char, Int, Dec, Dat, or Row)
                                  (actually either "Log" or anything else)
                           param() is an argument list to the function.
                           Super is an optional argument (normally omitted)
                             which if specified and NO will just fall out
                             of the include file to execute that code in
                             the function locally instead of doing SUPER().
